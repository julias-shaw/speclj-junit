# speclj-growl

`speclj-junit` is a plugin for [speclj](http://speclj.com/) that formats output using ant's junit XML format. This format is commonly used by continuous integration tools.

## Installation

Add the following to your project.clj under the :dev profile:

    :dependencies [[speclj-junit "0.0.11"]]

Speclj 3.3.x or later is required.

## Usage

Add `-f junit` to lein spec to output spec results in Ant's [JUnitReport task](https://ant.apache.org/manual/Tasks/junitreport.html) format.

    lein spec -f junit

This will write a junit.xml file to target that is suitable for integration with Jenkins and such.

## TODO

* Make output file configurable

## Thanks

Many thanks to Paul Gross for his [speclj-growl](https://github.com/pgr0ss/speclj-growl) project for a great example of writing speclj plugins.
